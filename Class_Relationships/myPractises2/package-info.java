/*
 *Demonstrate relationship among classes which include association, aggregation, composition and inheritance.
 *<p>
 *
 *All classes in this package are related to one another. The implementation of these classes along with creating classes instances are included in Main.java.
 *
 *Inspired and modified from lecture examples in Object Oriented Programming course that I'm taking currently, in semester 2 of CS degree(2022). Separate these classes from code exercises to avoid naming redundancy since all classes in this package have protected visibility.
