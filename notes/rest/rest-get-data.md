## Getting data from REST 
Web-based applications communicate with a server via API â€” various methods that can be processed through HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) requests. A controller is a part of the application that handles these API methods.

In this topic, we will take a look at how you can implement a basic REST-based controller for retrieving data through GET requests. The diagram below outlines the typical flow of a REST API when a GET request is sent to the server through Spring.

## Rest Controller

The @RestController annotation usually sits on top of the class. It makes a class provide exact endpoints (a requested URL) to access the REST methods. The class along with class methods can tell which requests suit your case. All appropriate requests will be sent to the specific method of this class.

Suppose that we want to create an API. When a user accesses a specific URL, they receive 1. To make it possible with Spring, we will implement two annotations. The first annotation is @RestController that is used to handle any REST requests sent by a user to the application. To create a @RestController, we should create a class and annotate it with @RestController:

- Java
```
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @RestController
  public class TaskController {

  }
```
- Kotlin
```
  @RestController
  class TaskController {

  }
```


The @RestController annotation is a wrapper of two different annotations:

1. @Controller contains handler methods for various requests. Since we opt for @RestController, the methods are related to REST requests.
    
2. @ResponseBody contains an object of each handler method. They will be represented in JSON format. When we send a request, the response we receive is in JSON format. This will become clear when we start working with objects in our GET requests.

We can implement methods to handle various REST requests in @RestController. To implement a GET request, we can use a @GetMapping annotation. It indicates what URL path should be associated with a GET request. After that, we can implement a method that is executed when the GET request is received at that path. For example, we can create a GET request that returns 1 when http://localhost:8080/test is accessed:


- Java
```
    @RestController
  public class TaskController {

      @GetMapping("/test")
      public int returnOne() {
          return 1;
      }
  }
```

- Kotlin
```
  @RestController
  class TaskController {
      @GetMapping("/test")
      fun returnOne(): Int {
          return 1
      }
  }
```
When you send a request to http://localhost:8080/test, you will receive 1 in return.

In addition to Postman, it is also possible to send a GETrequest to the server through a browser. To do so, simply open the browser, and navigate to the same URL as Postman (in this example, http://localhost:8080/test).

## GET with Collections

A list is a good way to store data. Sometimes, we want to return a full list or a specific list index when a GET request is received. We can adjust our @GetMapping annotation to do so.

We need to create a simple object to store in our list. Call it Task. It will implement a basic constructor as well as getters and setters for each of the object properties:

- Java
```
  public class Task {

      private int id;
      private String name;
      private String description;
      private boolean completed;

      public Task() {}

      public Task(int id, String name, String description, boolean completed) {
          this.id = id;
          this.name = name;
          this.description = description;
          this.completed = completed;
      }

      // getters and setters
  }
```

- Kotlin
```
    class Task(
        var id: Int,
        var name: String,
        var description: String,
        var completed: Boolean
    ) {

    }
```

It is very important to implement getters and setters. If they are not implemented, Spring will not be able to display object contents correctly. Spring will try to return all data from our controller in JSON format or similar. To construct a representation of our object that can be read properly, Spring needs getters and setters to access the object properties.

After that, we can implement a collection to store our tasks. We are going to use a list. When we work with Spring, we can end up facing a lot of GET requests at the same time. In this case, it would be a good idea to use an immutable collection to eliminate any thread-based issues. We also need to make sure that our collection can be used by our application:

- Java
```
  @RestController
  public class TaskController {
      private final List<Task> taskList = List.of(
              new Task(1, "task1", "A first test task", false),
              new Task(2, "task2", "A second test task", true)
      );
  }
```
- Kotlin
```
@RestController
class TaskController {
    val taskList = listOf(
        Task(1, "task1", "A first test task", false),
        Task(2, "task2", "A second test task", true)
    )
}
```
In the snippet above, we have created the Task list and populated it with sample tasks. You can start working with the object from a database query right away. After that, we need to create a @GetMapping function that can be used to retrieve data from the tasks collection.

- Java
```
  @RestController
  public class TaskController {
      private final List<Task> taskList = List.of(
              new Task(1, "task1", "A first test task", false),
              new Task(2, "task2", "A second test task", true)
      );

      @GetMapping("/tasks")
      public List<Task> getTasks() {
          return taskList;
      }
  }
```
- Kotlin
```
  @RestController
  class TaskController {
      val taskList = listOf(
          Task(1, "task1", "A first test task", false),
          Task(2, "task2", "A second test task", true)
      )

      @GetMapping("/tasks")
      fun getTasks(): List<Task> {
          return taskList
      }
  }
```

Now, when we make a request to http://localhost:8080/tasks/, we will see all tasks that have been added earlier:

In addition to a List, it is also possible to return other types of collections from a RestController. As in case of a list, a Set is converted to a JSON array. However, a Map is converted to a JSON key-value structure.

## @PathVariable

We may want to modify the code above so that users could enter an ID to specify which task they would like to retrieve. To do this, we will need to add a @PathVariable annotation to @GetMapping. The code below shows how we can add an ID to our getTask function:

- Java
```
  @RestController
  public class TaskController {
      private final List<Task> taskList = List.of(
          new Task(1, "task1", "A first test task", false),
          new Task(2, "task2", "A second test task", true)
      );

      @GetMapping("/tasks/{id}")
      public Task getTask(@PathVariable int id) {
          return taskList.get(id - 1); // list indices start from 0
      }
  }
```
- Kotlin
```
  @RestController
  class TaskController {
      val taskList = listOf(
          Task(1, "task1", "A first test task", false),
          Task(2, "task2", "A second test task", true)
      )

      @GetMapping("/tasks/{id}")
      fun getTask(@PathVariable id: Int): Task? {
          return taskList[id - 1] // list indices start from 0
      }
  }
```

We added {id} to the @GetMapping annotation to tell Spring that we expect the id parameter. We can place the id variable as @PathVariable in the arguments of our getTask method. It indicates to Spring how to map the parameter provided in @GetMapping to the function. After that, the function will return only one element rather than the whole collection. A request to http://localhost:8080/tasks/1 gives us the first task in the list:

However, if we provide an invalid id, the get method will throw an exception and we will receive a 500 error, similar to what is pictured below:

## Customizing the status code

By default, a method annotated with @GetMapping returns the status code 200 OK in the response if a request has been processed successfully and the status code 500 if there is an uncaught exception. However, we can change this default status code by returning an object of the ResponseEntity<T> class as the result.

There is an example below when we return 202 ACCEPTED instead of 200 OK.
  
- Java
```
  @GetMapping("/tasks/{id}")
  public ResponseEntity<Task> getTasks(@PathVariable int id) {
      return new ResponseEntity<>(taskList.get(id - 1), HttpStatus.ACCEPTED);
  }
```
- Kotlin
```
   @GetMapping("/tasks/{id}")
  fun getTasks(@PathVariable id: Int): ResponseEntity<Task?>? {
      return ResponseEntity(taskList[id - 1], HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
  } 
```

Actually, the status code 202 ACCEPTED is not the best example for this case, but it clearly demonstrates the possibility to change the status code.
