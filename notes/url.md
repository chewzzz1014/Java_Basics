## What is URL?
Imagine all files on the Internet are located in a megalopolis, each of them lucky to be living in their own home. Given the scale of the Internet, in the resulting settlement, there will be an unimaginable number of blocks and streets. For example, an interesting article, which you want to share with your friend, lives in one of the houses in the megalopolis. How do you explain where exactly to find the article? That's right, you need to come up with a single standard by which you could name all the addresses in the city, and then give your friend the street name and house number, just like in a real city!

All documents on the Internet have a personal address. 


Web pages, images, videos, and other documents that can be stored on your computer also have addresses. To make them look the same on the Internet, in 1990 the creators of the World Wide Web developed a special standard that defines what addresses should look like. That standard is called a URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It represents the standardized way of recording file addresses on the Internet.

The standard has one specific feature: not all characters can be used in URLs. The list of allowed characters includes:

- Latin alphabet (or English alphabet symbols);
- Cyrillic alphabet;
- Numbers;
- Reserved characters with special meaning !#$&'()*+,/:;=?@[];
- Unreserved characters: -_.~.
