/*
 * This package contains my code practices as well as lab assignments for polymorphism concept in Object-Oriented Programming. This concept was taught in week 6 of semester 2 in my CS degree.
 * 
 * Classes that have relationships to each other:
 * 
 * 1. - Car
 *    	- Caravan
 *    	- MVP
 *    	- Sedan
 *    -TestCar
 *    
 * 2.  (refer the UML diagram for details https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chewzzz1014/file@2df934ab53f6bea6705ce71dfa15d044e3b92f0b/n1.drawio.png )
 *   - Shape
 * 	  	- TwoDimensional
 * 			- Circle
 * 			- Triangle
 * 			- Square
 * 	  	- ThreeDimensional
 * 			- Cube
 * 			- Sphere
 * 
 * 
 * Formulae for shapes:
 *		circle area: pie r^2
 *		triangle area: 0.5*b*h
 *		square area: l*w
 *		
 *		cube: 6*(l^2), (l^3)
 *		sphere: 4*pie*(r^2), (4/3)*pie*(r^2)
 *
