/*
 * Code I've written in Week 7 of Semester 2 during my CS degree.
 * 
 *  I attempted to apply different way of try and catch exception in the code I've written few weeks ago. 
 *  
 *  This gave me basic exposure to Exception Handling in Java. 
 *  I will implement it in all of my code (Sem 1 and Week 1-6 Sem 2) when I am completely understood of this topic and master it well.
