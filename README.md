## Overview
- Collection of Java code and simple Java projects I built. (not Spring/Spring Boot projects) 
- Contains all Java programs I've written during my degree, self-paced courses and learnings.
- Branch `main` commit Java source code
- Branch `JavaFX` commit JavaFX source code

  > UPDATES: The code on branch `JavaFX` has been moved to branch `main`, as I was unable to merge 2 branches due to huge differences in git histories. I have migrated from using Eclipse to IntelliJ and had many errors and challenges due to build/run/package configuration across different IDEs. Hence I will move the existing unorganised code into Maven projects from time to time.
